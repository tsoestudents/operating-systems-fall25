- Commands executed via /bin/sh -c (no system()).
- Missing files print perror-style errors.
- Lines starting with '#' or '//' are treated as comments.
- Cyclic dependencies are detected and abort execution with an error.
- 'file' works both as a source (read) and a sink (write via to= in pipe).
- Input strictly follows the assignmentâ€™s .flow format.
